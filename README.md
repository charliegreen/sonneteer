<b><i>Note: see my new project [poeteer](http://github.com/charliegreen/poeteer) for a faster, more generalized, and overall better version of sonneteer</i></b>

An automatic sonnet generator! It uses the [CMU pronouncing dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict?in=C+M+U+Dictionary&stress=-s) to assemble 14 lines of strict iambic pentameter with the rhyme scheme ABABCDCDEFEFGG, in compliance with the classic Shakespearean sonnet.

Note that this is done rather naively at the moment; it routinely takes many minutes to create one sonnet.

Here is its first sonnet:  
>BRONCHITIS NISTLER SALAMANCA GULL  
>INCLUDE KORPELA LEPP DARTEZ DISJOINT  
>APPEALED ULIMA HICKMON TAYLOE DULLE  
>ASSIGN LORENA'S BELA RIEDERS' POINT  
>MORESO FLEISHMAN SMOKING'S WOW QUINONES  
>SOFIANS SHENA OPTIMISTIC LEAGUES  
>ASSASSINATE COTILLA BISHOP'S KNOWNS  
>PUOPOLO RHODY CLIFTON MATTOX TIEGS  
>TAVANO DAVYDOV ZABAWA CROPP  
>ACCOUNTANT'S BLAYNEY MAYLE ELISE MARCHAND  
>CARRIERE MACKO KORF DUCOTE BE CROP  
>CHIASSO SIMCO YEO GUST OF FS THS HAND  
>EFFECTING NESTS BESIEGED INEBRIATE  
>SEVIGNY THOMAN TWINED UNEARNED THS DE TAITT  

Though its beauty and insight are undeniable, it ought to be known that I am working on making the sonnets come out in an at least slightly legible fashion.
